# RISC-V-Tapeout-chip-program-week-0-
Welcome to my journey of RISC-V  this program deals with design , verification and tapeout of a custom processsor based on open source RISC-V instruction set . week-0 contains the design flow of an SoC. the design flow starts with the C level program which is further converted into RTL Level then sub divided into processor and peripherals/IPs.
